= FXGL using Maven

This is an example of a basic Maven configuration for creating FXGL games on Java 17+ using Java and/or Kotlin.

NOTE: This template was adapted from https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL-MavenGradle[this project template].

For actual game examples, please see https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames[FXGLGames].

You may wish to update the FXGL version to https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL#maven[latest].

== Run via Maven

[source,bash]
----
mvn javafx:run
----

== Requirements

This project uses FXGL 21, which requires Java 21.  

If you want to change the version of Java, you can change it in the `package.json`, `pom.xml`, and `.github/workflows/jdeploy.yml` files.

== Publishing Releases

This project will generate releases (desktop installers) automatically on each git commit. See https://www.jdeploy.com/docs/intellij-plugin-tutorial[this tutorial for details].

You can download releases on the  https://github.com/null/releases[repository releases page].

=== DMG Releases

By default Mac releases use an installer.  You can optionally enable DMG releases also by setting the variable `JDEPLOY_CREATE_DMG=true` in your repository settings.
You will also need to define the following secrets:

. `MAC_DEVELOPER_ID` : Your email address for your Apple developer account.
. `MAC_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64` : A base64 encoding of your Mac developer certificate (p12)
. `MAC_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` : The password you used for your Mac developer certificate p12, when you exported it from your keychain.
. `MAC_NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD` : The application-specific password that you set for notarization in your Apple developer account.
